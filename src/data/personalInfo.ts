  bio: `Passionate blockchain developer with 5+ years of experience building secure, scalable DeFi protocols and smart contracts. Specialized in Ethereum ecosystem development with expertise in Solidity, advanced testing frameworks, and gas optimization techniques.

I have successfully launched multiple DeFi protocols managing over $50M in total value locked, with a focus on security-first development and innovative financial primitives. My work includes yield farming strategies, cross-chain bridges, and governance systems.

Currently exploring cutting-edge areas like MEV protection, account abstraction, and zero-knowledge proofs to push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralized finance.`,
